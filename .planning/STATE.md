# Project State

**Last updated:** 2026-03-30

## Status

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Phase 1: Foundation | In progress | Plan 02/05 complete |

## Active Decisions

- **01-02 (Nginx):** No /uploads/ static location block — all file access via authenticated Express endpoint (FR-06.11, SVG XSS prevention)
- **01-02 (Nginx):** client_max_body_size 12m on HTTPS vhost level (not inside location blocks) so it applies globally to receipts subdomain
- **01-02 (Nginx):** Placeholder domain receipts.yourdomain.com used; must be replaced with actual subdomain before deployment

## Blockers

None.

## Notes

- Hetzner VPS already running Restaurant app; new Docker stack must use ports 4000/4001
- Resend requires domain verification (SPF/DKIM) before email invitations work — do this in Phase 2
- libvips with HEIC support must be installed in Docker image (Phase 5) — `apt-get install libvips-dev libheif-dev`
